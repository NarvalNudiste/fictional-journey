Fully adjustable metal material with rust, dirt, scratches and opacity parameters. By using those we are able to create plenty of variations. 
Material allows you to create multiple metal variations such as: steel, chrome, copper, painted, etc. 
In addition you can use up to 3 normal maps which will be used in material generation process as well as 4 images
with adjustable position size and rotation that can be used as decals, graffities, etc.

To achieve best computing performance, tweak the substance with low resolution setting (ie. 256x256).
Using higher resolutions will result in slower computation.

Known issues / bugs / workarounds :

- When inputting normal map into substance, normal map has to be flagged as texture in Unity (Unity 5.3.5 and earlier).
- Oxidation effects exist only for few metal, other effects will be continuously added.
- When inputing a decal with uneven size the sizes in substance have to be set according to image ratio.
  (Ex. when inputing image with 1024x512 size it has to be set with 2:1 ratio: 50:25, 20:10 etc. to maintain correct aspect).
- In older versions of Unity the substance procedural parameters group and their inputs are placed incorrectly.
